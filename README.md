# Submarine-Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a sonar reading corresponds to a rock or a mine. The sonar readings consist of various signal measurements obtained from a submarine's sonar equipment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Mines vs. Rocks dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pQxtljlNVh0DHYg-Ye7dtpDTlFceHVfa/view) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 208 sonar readings, each with 60 features representing the strength of different frequency bands. The corresponding labels indicate whether the reading corresponds to a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`).

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the results, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```shell
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
